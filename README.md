# Sending emails using Python
This allows to send emails to different people with similar but slightly different content such as header. The values that need to be changed depending on the client is stored in a dictionary and uses a template in the string library to change those values. The two files are "send_email.py" which is the program to be run and "content.txt" which is the actual email to be sent.

# How to Run
The two files should be in the same directory and run the program by typing the following:

    python3 send_email.py
